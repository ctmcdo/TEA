An app that collects info about events from Facebook.

# About

This is a mirror of an app initially made  by myself and two friends in third year of undergrad. We were Colin, Abhinav (Garg) and Shekhar (Jain), and therefore named the project CASper. Patrick Finlay also joined, funnily also contributing to the acronym. It was renamed to Trinity Events App (TEA) at some point.

After working on it for sometime we convinced a lecturer supervising our practical software engineering module to let the project be one of the two projects that could be worked on, and hence around half the class was working on it.

Some of the guys worked on an IOS version: [TEA-IOS](https://github.com/joebloggs999/TEA_iOS)

We entered Trinity Entrepreneurial Society's Dragon's Den, and made it past the first
round (thanks to Paddy :-) ), and onto the second which was also the final. It was an interesting experience.

Unfortunately the backend scripts don't seem to be versioned.
